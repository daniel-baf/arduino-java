## Overview

This project combines Arduino and Java to create a versatile home automation system. The functionalities include turning on or off lights in multiple rooms, controlling a garage door with a servo motor, and selecting a Bluetooth device to send data through serial communication.

## Technologies Used

- **Arduino**: Acts as the main controller, managing and executing tasks based on input received from the Java application.

- **Java**: The Java application provides a user interface to control the smart home features and communicates with the Arduino board through serial communication.

## Functionalities

1. **Room Lights Control:**
   - Turn on or off lights in multiple rooms remotely using the Java application.

2. **Garage Door Control:**
   - Open or close a garage door using a servo motor controlled by the Arduino board.

3. **Bluetooth Device Selection:**
   - Select a Bluetooth device from the Java application to establish a connection for serial communication with the Arduino board.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/daniel-baf/arduino-java.git
   ```

2. **Open Arduino IDE:**
   - Open the Arduino sketch (.ino) file in the Arduino IDE.
   - Upload the sketch to your Arduino board.

3. **Open Java Project:**
   - Navigate to the 'java' directory in the cloned repository.
   - Open the Java project using your preferred Java development environment (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse).

4. **Configure Bluetooth Connection:**
   - Configure the Bluetooth settings in the Java application to select the desired device for serial communication.

5. **Run the Java Application: APK**
   - Run the Java application to launch the user interface for controlling the smart home functionalities.

6. **Test Functionality:**
   - Test each functionality, including room lights control and garage door operation, to ensure proper communication with the Arduino board.
