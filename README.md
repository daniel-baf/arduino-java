# Arduino Serial Communication Project - Smart House

## Overview

This project involves the use of Arduino in conjunction with Kotlin and JavaScript embedded into MIT App Inventor 2 to create a smart house system. The goal is to establish serial communication between the Arduino board and a mobile application to control various functions within a smart home environment.

## Technologies Used

- **Arduino**: The Arduino board serves as the central controller for the smart house, managing and executing various tasks based on input received from the mobile application.

- **Kotlin**: Kotlin is used to develop the mobile application that communicates with the Arduino board. It facilitates the creation of a user-friendly interface for controlling and monitoring smart home functionalities.

- **JavaScript (Embedded into MIT App Inventor 2)**: JavaScript is embedded into MIT App Inventor 2 to enhance the mobile application's capabilities. It allows for additional functions and features to be implemented seamlessly.

## Functionality

The smart house system includes but is not limited to the following functionalities:

- **Remote Lighting Control**: Control the lighting system in different rooms of the house remotely.

- **Temperature and Climate Control**: Adjust and monitor the temperature and climate settings within the house through the mobile application.

- **Security Features**: Implement security measures such as door/window sensors and surveillance camera controls.

- **Energy Management**: Monitor and manage energy consumption in the house by controlling devices and appliances.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/smart-house-arduino.git
   ```

2. **Open Arduino IDE:**
   - Open the Arduino sketch (.ino) file in the Arduino IDE.
   - Upload the sketch to your Arduino board.

3. **Open MIT App Inventor 2:**
   - Import the provided .aia file into MIT App Inventor 2.
   - Customize the mobile application interface and functionalities as needed.

4. **Run the Mobile Application:**
   - Install the mobile application on your device.
   - Connect the mobile application to the Arduino board via serial communication.
